		<p>I'm in my third and final year of Graphic Design at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada.<br>
		I enjoy making graphic illustrations, I adore all aspects of branding and package design, making logos and having fun with music posters, business cards, and the like.<br>
		I'm excited to see where this year will take me.
		<p>Keep in touch to see where I'm headed in the near future!</p>
